This project involves E-Commerce Customer Behaviour Analysis with transaction data that contains churn and other variables that are useful to understand the customer behavior. This project will employ analytics techniques, particularly Decision Trees and ensemble methods (bagging and boosting), to build a robust churn prediction model. By leveraging machine learning, we can identify potential churners and understand the key drivers behind customer attrition.

Objectives:

1) To study the customer behavior and how the variables related to churn
2) To produce Churn prediction model with Decision Trees and ensemble methods
3) To compare the model performance of different models.
4) To gain insights on how to improve business

Talend Data Integration: Used to combined 2 datasets that have the same row of customer ID

Talend Data Preparation: Used to inspect the data first hand and perform data standardization

SAS Enterprise Miner: Handle missing values and perform modeling with Decision Tree, Decsion Tree ensembles, HP Random Forest and Gradient Boosting

Further workflow, results and analysis can be read from the written report


Reflections or Learning Outcomes: The challenges would be producing a sensible and good results within a time period, the challenge arise when there are a lot parameters, results and decision making involved when performing data mining workflow. However, when there is time limit, then we need to balance trade off between producing sensible results on time and include more detailed analysis and results. The other challenge would be the data itself and this has caused several issues with modeling section. If the data is not good enough, often times the results produced from the modeling section does not meet your expectations and you have to revisit the data section.
